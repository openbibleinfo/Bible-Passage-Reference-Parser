# This class takes a string and identifies Bible passage references in that string. It's designed to handle how people actually type Bible passages and tries fairly hard to make sense of dubious possibilities.
# 
# The aggressiveness is tunable, to a certain extent, using the below `options`. It's probably too aggressive for general text parsing (the "is 2" in "There is 2 much" becomes "Isa.2", for example).

# Export to whatever the current context is.

	# ## Main Options
	options:
		# ### OSIS Output
		# * `combine`:  "Matt 5, 6, 7" -> "Matt.5-Matt.7".
		# * `separate`: "Matt 5, 6, 7" -> "Matt.5,Matt.6,Matt.7".
		consecutive_combination_strategy: "combine"
		# * `b`: OSIS refs get reduced to the shortest possible. "Gen.1.1-Gen.50.26" and "Gen.1-Gen.50" -> "Gen", while "Gen.1.1-Gen.2.25" -> "Gen.1-Gen.2".
		# * `bc`: OSIS refs get reduced to complete chapters if possible, but not whole books. "Gen.1.1-Gen.50.26" -> "Gen.1-Gen.50".
		# * `bcv`: OSIS refs always include the full book, chapter, and verse. "Gen.1" -> "Gen.1.1-Gen.1.31".
		osis_compaction_strategy: "b"
		# ### Sequence
		# * `ignore`: ignore any books on their own in sequences ("Gen Is 1" -> "Isa.1").
		# * `include`: any books that appear on their own get parsed according to `book_alone_strategy` ("Gen Is 1" means "Gen.1-Gen.50,Isa.1" if `book_alone_strategy` is `full` or `ignore`, or "Gen.1,Isa.1" if it's `first_chapter`).
		book_sequence_strategy: "ignore"
		# * `ignore`: "Matt 99, Gen 1" sequence index starts at `Gen 1`.
		# * `include`: "Matt 99, Gen 1" sequence index starts at `Matt 99`.
		invalid_sequence_strategy: "ignore"
		# * `combine`: consecutive references are combined into a single OSIS list: Gen 1, 2 -> "Gen.1,Gen.2".
		# * `separate`: consecutive references are separated into their component parts: Gen 1, 2 -> "Gen.1" and "Gen.2".
		sequence_combination_strategy: "combine"
		# ### Potentially Invalid Input
		# * `ignore`: Don't include invalid passages in `@parsed_entities()`.
		# * `include`: Include invalid passages in `@parsed_entities()` (they still don't have OSIS values).
		invalid_passage_strategy: "ignore"
		# * `error`: zero chapters ("Matt 0") are invalid.
		# * `upgrade`: zero chapters are upgraded to 1: "Matt 0" -> "Matt 1".
		# Unlike `zero_verse_strategy`, chapter 0 isn't allowed.
		zero_chapter_strategy: "error"
		# * `error`: zero verses ("Matt 5:0") are invalid.
		# * `upgrade`: zero verses are upgraded to 1: "Matt 5:0" -> "Matt 5:1".
		# * `allow`: zero verses are kept as-is: "Matt 5:0" -> "Matt 5:0". Some traditions use 0 for Psalm titles.
		zero_verse_strategy: "error"
		# * `ignore`: treat non-Latin digits the same as any other character.
		# * `replace`: replace non-Latin (0-9) numeric digits with Latin digits. This replacement occurs before any book substitution.
		non_latin_digits_strategy: "ignore"
		# ### Context
		# * `ignore`: any books that appear on their own don't get parsed as books ("Gen saw" doesn't trigger a match, but "Gen 1" does).
		# * `full`: any books that appear on their own get parsed as the complete book ("Gen" means "Gen.1-Gen.50").
		# * `first_chapter`: any books that appear on their own get parsed as the first chapter ("Gen" means "Gen.1").
		book_alone_strategy: "ignore"
		# * `delete`: remove any digits at the end of a sequence that are preceded by spaces and immediately followed by a `\w`: "Matt 5 1Hi" -> "Matt.5". This is better for text extraction.
		# * `include`: keep any digits at the end of a sequence that are preceded by spaces and immediately followed by a `\w`: "Matt 5 1Hi" -> "Matt.5.1". This is better for query parsing.
		captive_end_digits_strategy: "delete"
		# * `verse`: treat "Jer 33-11" as "Jer 33:11" (end before start) and "Heb 13-15" as "Heb.13.15" (end range too high).
		# * `sequence`: treat them as sequences.
		end_range_digits_strategy: "verse"
		# ### Apocrypha
		# Don't set this value directly; use the `include_apocrypha` or `set_options` functions.
		include_apocrypha: false
		# `c`: treat references to Psalm 151 (if using the Apocrypha) as a chapter: "Psalm 151:1" -> "Ps.151.1"
		# `b`: treat references to Psalm 151 (if using the Apocrypha) as a book: "Psalm 151:1" -> "Ps151.1.1". Be aware that for ranges starting or ending in Psalm 151, you'll get two OSISes, regardless of the `sequence_combination_strategy`: "Psalms 149-151" -> "Ps.149-Ps.150,Ps151.1" Setting this option to `b` is the only way to correctly parse OSISes that treat `Ps151` as a book.
		ps151_strategy: "c"
		# ### Versification System
		# Don't set this value directly; use the `versification_system` or `set_options` functions.
		# * `default`: the default ESV-style versification. Also used in AMP and NASB.
		# * `ceb`: use CEB versification, which varies mostly in the Apocrypha.
		# * `kjv`: use KJV versification, with one fewer verse in 3John. Also used in NIV and NKJV.
		# `nab`: use NAB versification, which generally follows the Septuagint.
		# * `nlt`: use NLT versification, with one extra verse in Rev. Also used in NCV.
		# * `nrsv`: use NRSV versification.
		# * `vulgate`: use Vulgate (Greek) numbering for the Psalms.
		versification_system: "default"
		# ### Case Sensitivity
		# Don't use this value directly; use the `set_options` function. Changing this option repeatedly will slow down execution.
		# * `none`: All matches are case-insensitive.
		# * `books`: Book names are case-sensitive. Everything else is still case-insensitive.
