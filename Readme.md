# Bible Passage Reference Parser

Try a [demo of the Bible passage reference parser](http://www.openbible.info/labs/reference-parser/).

This project is a Coffeescript implementation of a Bible-passage reference parser (e.g., seeing `John 3:16` and both understanding that it's a Bible reference and converting it into a form that computers can process). It parses Bible **B**ooks, **C**hapters, and **V**erses--thus the file names involving "BCV Parser."

Its primary use is to interpret query strings for use in a Bible application. It can extract BCVs from text but may be too aggressive for some uses. (See "Caveats" below.)

It should be fairly speedy: using Node.js 0.10.5, it parses 2,000 tweets per second on a single core of an EC2 High-CPU Medium instance.

The code occupies about 84KB minified and 19KB gzipped.

This project also provides extensively commented code and 460,000 real-world strings that you can use as a starting point to build your own BCV parser.

## Usage

For English, include `js/en_bcv_parser.min.js` in your project. For other languages, include the relevant `js/*_bcv_parser.js`.

These usage examples are in Javascript. You can also use Coffeescript, of course.

### Setup: In a Browser

```html
<script src="/path/js/en_bcv_parser.min.js"></script>
<script>
	var bcv = new bcv_parser;
</script>
```

### Setup: Node.js

```javascript
var bcv_parser = require("/path/js/en_bcv_parser.min.js");
var bcv = new bcv_parser.bcv_parser;
```

### Parsing

Assuming you have an object named `bcv`:

#### `.parse("")`

This function does the parsing. It returns the `bcv` object and is suitable for chaining.

```javascript
bcv.parse("John 3:16"); // Returns the `bcv` object.
```

#### `.osis()`

This function returns a single OSIS for the entire input, ignoring translations.

```javascript
bcv.parse("John 3:16 NIV").osis(); // "John.3.16"
bcv.parse("John 3:16-17").osis(); // "John.3.16-John.3.17"
bcv.parse("John 3:16,18").osis(); // "John.3.16,John.3.18"
bcv.parse("John 3:16,18. ### Matthew 1 (NIV, ESV)").osis(); // "John.3.16,John.3.18,Matt.1"
```

#### `.osis_and_translations()`

This function returns an array. Each element in the array is an `[OSIS, Translation]` pair (both are strings).

```javascript
bcv.parse("John 3:16 NIV").osis_and_translations(); // [["John.3.16", "NIV"]]
bcv.parse("John 3:16-17").osis_and_translations(); // [["John.3.16-John.3.17", ""]]
bcv.parse("John 3:16,18").osis_and_translations(); // [["John.3.16,John.3.18", ""]]
bcv.parse("John 3:16,18. ### Matthew 1 (NIV, ESV)").osis_and_translations(); // [["John.3.16,John.3.18", ""], ["Matt.1", "NIV,ESV"]]
```

#### `.osis_and_indices()`

This function returns an array. Each element in the array is an object with `osis` (a string), `translations` (an array of translation identifiers--an empty string unless a translation is specified), and `indices` (the start and end position in the string). The `indices` key is designed to be consistent with Twitter's implementation (the first character in a string has indices `[0, 1]`).

```javascript
bcv.parse("John 3:16 NIV").osis_and_indices(); // [{"osis": "John.3.16", "translations": ["NIV"], "indices": [0, 13]}]
bcv.parse("John 3:16-17").osis_and_indices(); // [{"osis": "John.3.16-John.3.17", "translations": [""], "indices": [0, 12]}]
bcv.parse("John 3:16,18").osis_and_indices(); // [{"osis": "John.3.16,John.3.18", "translations": [""], "indices": [0, 12]}]
bcv.parse("John 3:16,18. ### Matthew 1 (NIV, ESV)").osis_and_indices(); // [{"osis": "John.3.16,John.3.18", "translations": [""], "indices":[0, 12]}, {"osis": "Matt.1", "translations": ["NIV","ESV"], "indices": [18, 38]}]
```

#### `.verse_iterator()`

This function returns an iterator, an object with one useful method (`.next`); every time `.next` is called on the iterator it returns the next verse within the parsed range in OSIS format:

```javascript
var it = bcv.parse("John 3:16-18, 22").verse_iterator();
it.next(); // "John.3.16"
it.next(); // "John.3.17"
it.next(); // "John.3.18"
it.next(); // "John.3.22"
```

#### `.contiguous_verse_range_iterator()`

This function returns an iterator, an object with one useful method (`.next`); every time `.next` is called on the iterator it returns the next contiguous range of verses within the same chapter in OSIS format:

```javascript
var it = bcv.parse("John 3:16-6:10,6:12; Acts 3:1-11").contiguous_verse_range_iterator()
it.next(); // "John.3.16-36"
it.next(); // "John.4.1-54"
it.next(); // "John.5.1-47"
it.next(); // "John.6.1-10"
it.next(); // "John.6.12"
it.next(); // "Acts.3.1-11"
```

#### `.parsed_entities()`

If you want to know a lot about how the BCV parser handled the input string, use this function. It can include messages if it adjusted the input or had trouble parsing it (e.g., if given an invalid reference).

This function returns an array with a fairly complicated structure. The `entities` key can contain nested entities if you're parsing a sequence of references.

```javascript
bcv.set_options({"invalid_passage_strategy": "include", "invalid_sequence_strategy": "include"});
bcv.parse("John 3, 99").parsed_entities();
/*
[{ "osis": "John.3",
   "indices": [0, 10],
   "translations": [""],
   "entity_id": 0,
   "entities": [
   		{ "osis": "John.3",
		  "type": "bc",
		  "indices": [0, 6],
		  "translations": [""],
		  "start": { "b": "John", "c": 3, "v": 1 },
		  "end": { "b": "John", "c": 3, "v": 36 },
		  "enclosed_indices": [-1, -1],
		  "entity_id": 0,
		  "entities": [{
			"start": { "b": "John", "c": 3, "v": 1 },
			"end": { "b": "John", "c": 3, "v": 36 },
			"valid": { "valid": true, "messages": {} },
			"type": "bc",
			"absolute_indices": [0, 6],
			"enclosed_absolute_indices": [-1, -1]
			}]
		},
		{ "osis": "",
		  "type": "integer",
		  "indices": [8, 10],
		  "translations": [""],
		  "start": { "b": "John", "c": 99 },
		  "end": { "b": "John", "c": 99 },
		  "enclosed_indices": [-1, -1],
		  "entity_id": 0,
		  "entities": [{
			"start": { "b": "John", "c": 99 },
			"end": { "b": "John", "c": 99 },
			"valid": { "valid": false, "messages": { "start_chapter_not_exist": 21 } },
			"type": "integer",
			"absolute_indices": [8, 10],
			"enclosed_absolute_indices": [-1, -1]
			}]
		}
   	]
}]
*/
```

You may also see an `alternates` object if you provide an ambiguous book abbreviation (`Ph 2` could mean "Phil.2" or "Phlm.1.2").

#### `.include_apocrypha()`

This function takes a single Boolean value (`true` or `false`). If `true`, it tries to find the following books in the Apocrypha (or Deuterocanonicals): Tob, Jdt, GkEsth, Wis, Sir, Bar, PrAzar, Sus, Bel, SgThree, EpJer, 1Macc, 2Macc, 3Macc, 4Macc, 1Esd, 2Esd, PrMan, Ps151. Your canon may vary in the number of books, their order, or the number of verses in each chapter. If you set the value to `false` (the default behavior), it ignores books in the Apocrypha.

```javascript
bcv.parse("Tobit 1").osis(); // ""
bcv.include_apocrypha(true);
bcv.parse("Tobit 1").osis(); // "Tob.1"
```

You shouldn't call `include_apocrypha()` between calling `parse()` and one of the output functions--the output reflects the value of `include_apocrypha()` that was active during the call to `parse()`. You probably also don't want to call it every time you call `parse()`--it will slow down execution.

#### `.set_options({})`

This function takes an object that sets parsing and output options. See "Options" below for available keys and values. This function doesn't enforce valid values, but using values other than the ones described in "Options" will lead to unexpected behavior.

```javascript
bcv.set_options({"osis_compaction_strategy": "bcv"});
bcv.parse("Genesis 1").osis(); // "Gen.1.1-Gen.1.31"
```

### Options

#### OSIS Output

* `consecutive_combination_strategy: "combine"`
	* `combine`:  "Matt 5, 6, 7" -> "Matt.5-Matt.7".
	* `separate`: "Matt 5, 6, 7" -> "Matt.5,Matt.6,Matt.7".
* `osis_compaction_strategy: "b"`
	* `b`: OSIS refs get reduced to the shortest possible. "Gen.1.1-Gen.50.26" and "Gen.1-Gen.50" -> "Gen", while "Gen.1.1-Gen.2.25" -> "Gen.1-Gen.2".
	* `bc`: OSIS refs get reduced to complete chapters if possible, but not whole books. "Gen.1.1-Gen.50.26" -> "Gen.1-Gen.50".
	* `bcv`: OSIS refs always include the full book, chapter, and verse. "Gen.1" -> "Gen.1.1-Gen.1.31".

#### Sequence

* `book_sequence_strategy: "ignore"`
	* `ignore`: ignore any books on their own in sequences ("Gen Is 1" -> "Isa.1").
	* `include`: any books that appear on their own get parsed according to `book_alone_strategy` ("Gen Is 1" means "Gen.1-Gen.50,Isa.1" if `book_alone_strategy` is `full` or `ignore`, or "Gen.1,Isa.1" if it's `first_chapter`).
* `invalid_sequence_strategy: "ignore"`
	* `ignore`: "Matt 99, Gen 1" sequence index starts at `Gen 1`.
	* `include`: "Matt 99, Gen 1" sequence index starts at `Matt 99`.
* `sequence_combination_strategy: "combine"`
	* `combine`: consecutive references are combined into a single OSIS list: Gen 1, 2 -> "Gen.1,Gen.2".
	* `separate`: consecutive references are separated into their component parts: Gen 1, 2 -> "Gen.1" and "Gen.2".

#### Potentially Invalid Input

* `invalid_passage_strategy: "ignore"`
	* `ignore`: Don't include invalid passages in `@parsed_entities()`.
	* `include`: Include invalid passages in `@parsed_entities()` (they still don't have OSIS values).
* `zero_chapter_strategy: "error"`
	* `error`: zero chapters ("Matt 0") are invalid.
	* `upgrade`: zero chapters are upgraded to 1: "Matt 0" -> "Matt 1".
	* Unlike `zero_verse_strategy`, chapter 0 isn't allowed.
* `zero_verse_strategy: "error"`
	* `error`: zero verses ("Matt 5:0") are invalid.
	* `upgrade`: zero verses are upgraded to 1: "Matt 5:0" -> "Matt 5:1".
	* `allow`: zero verses are kept as-is: "Matt 5:0" -> "Matt 5:0". Some traditions use 0 for Psalm titles.
* `non_latin_digits_strategy: "ignore"`
	* `ignore`: treat non-Latin digits the same as any other character.
	* `replace`: replace non-Latin (0-9) numeric digits with Latin digits. This replacement occurs before any book substitution.

#### Context

* `book_alone_strategy: "ignore"`
	* `ignore`: any books that appear on their own don't get parsed as books ("Gen saw" doesn't trigger a match, but "Gen 1" does).
	* `full`: any books that appear on their own get parsed as the complete book ("Gen" means "Gen.1-Gen.50").
	* `first_chapter`: any books that appear on their own get parsed as the first chapter ("Gen" means "Gen.1").
* `captive_end_digits_strategy: "delete"`
	* `delete`: remove any digits at the end of a sequence that are preceded by spaces and immediately followed by a `\w`: "Matt 5 1Hi" -> "Matt.5". This is better for text extraction.
	* `include`: keep any digits at the end of a sequence that are preceded by spaces and immediately followed by a `\w`: "Matt 5 1Hi" -> "Matt.5.1". This is better for query parsing.
* `end_range_digits_strategy: "verse"`
	* `verse`: treat "Jer 33-11" as "Jer 33:11" (end before start) and "Heb 13-15" as "Heb.13.15" (end range too high).
	* `sequence`: treat them as sequences.

#### Apocrypha
* `ps151_strategy: "c"`
	* `c`: treat references to Psalm 151 (if using the Apocrypha) as a chapter: "Psalm 151:1" -> "Ps.151.1"
	* `b`: treat references to Psalm 151 (if using the Apocrypha) as a book: "Psalm 151:1" -> "Ps151.1.1". Be aware that for ranges starting or ending in Psalm 151, you'll get two OSISes, regardless of the `sequence_combination_strategy`: "Psalms 149-151" -> "Ps.149-Ps.150,Ps151.1". Setting this option to `b` is the only way to correctly parse OSISes that treat `Ps151` as a book.

#### Versification
* `versification_system: "default"`
	* `default`: the default ESV-style versification. Also used in AMP and NASB.
	* `ceb`: use CEB versification, which varies mostly in the Apocrypha.
	* `kjv`: use KJV versification, with one fewer verse in 3John. Also used in NIV and NKJV.
	* `nab`: use NAB versification, which generally follows the Septuagint.
	* `nlt`: use NLT versification, with one extra verse in Rev. Also used in NCV.
	* `nrsv`: use NRSV versification.
	* `vulgate`: use Vulgate numbering for the Psalms.

#### Case Sensitivity
`case_sensitive: "none"`
	* `none`: All matches are case-insensitive.
	* `books`: Book names are case-sensitive. Everything else is still case-insensitive.

### Messages

If you're calling `parsed_entities()` directly, the following keys can appear in `messages`; they don't always indicate an invalid reference; they may just indicate the chosen parsing strategy.

#### Start Objects

* `start_book_not_exist`: `true` if the given book doesn't exist in the translation. A book has to have an entry in the language's `regexps.coffee` file for this message to appear.
* `start_chapter_is_zero`:  `1` if the requested start chapter is 0.
* `start_chapter_not_exist_in_single_chapter_book`: `1` if wanting, say, `Philemon 2`. It is reparsed as a verse (`Philemon 1:2`).
* `start_chapter_not_exist`: The value is the last valid chapter in the book.
* `start_chapter_not_numeric`: `true` if the start chapter isn't a number. You should never see this message.
* `start_verse_is_zero`: `1` if the requested start verse is 0.
* `start_verse_not_exist`: The value is the last valid verse in the chapter.
* `start_verse_not_numeric`: `true` if the start verse isn't a number. You should never see this message.

#### End Objects

* `end_book_before_start`: `true` if the end book is before the start book (the order is controlled in the language's `translations.coffee`). E.g., `Exodus-Genesis`.
* `end_book_not_exist`: `true` if the given book doesn't exist in the translation. A book has to have an entry in the language's `regexps.coffee` for this message to appear.
* `end_chapter_before_start`: `true` if the end chapter is before the start chapter in the same book.
* `end_chapter_is_zero`: `1` if the requested end chapter is `0`. The `1` indicates the first valid chapter.
* `end_chapter_not_exist`: The value is the last valid chapter in the book.
* `end_chapter_not_exist_in_single_chapter_book`: `1` if wanting, say, `Philemon 2-3`. It is reparsed as a verse (`Philemon 1:2-3`).
* `end_chapter_not_numeric`: `true` if the end chapter isn't a number. You should never see this message.
* `end_verse_not_numeric`: `true` if the end verse isn't a number. You should never see this message.
* `end_verse_before_start`: `true` if the end verse is before the start verse in the same book and chapter.
* `end_verse_is_zero`: `1` if the requested end verse is `0`. The `1` indicates the first valid verse.
* `end_verse_not_exist`: The value is the last valid verse in the chapter.

#### Translation Objects

* `translation_invalid`: `true` if an invalid translation sequence appears.
* `translation_unknown`: The translation is unknown. If you see this message, a translation exists in `bcv_parser::regexps.translations` but not in `bcv_parser::translations`.

## Caveats

The parser is quite aggressive in identifying text as Bible references; if you just hand it raw text, you will probably encounter false positives, where the parser identifies text as Bible references even when it isn't. For example, in the string `she is 2 cool`, the `is 2` becomes `Isa.2`.

The parser spends most of its time doing regular expressions and manipulating strings. If you give it a very long string full of Bible references, it could block your main event loop. Depending on your performance requirements, parsing large numbers of even short strings could saturate your CPU and lead to problems.

In addition, a number of the tests in the "real-world" section of `src/core/spec.coffee` have comments describing limitations of the parser. Unfortunately, it's hard to solve them without incorrectly parsing other cases--one person intends `Matt 1, 3` to mean `Matt.1,Matt.3`, while another intends it to mean `Matt.1.3`.

## Tests

One of the hardest parts of building a BCV parser is finding data to test it on to tease out corner cases. The file `src/core/spec.coffee` has a few hundred tests that tripped up this parser at various points in development.

In addition, the file `test/tests.zip` has 460,000 tests drawn from 115 million real-world tweets and Facebook posts. These tests reflect the most-popular ways of identifying passages--each entry in the `Text` column occurs in ten or more tweets or posts. (The total number of unique passage strings in the corpus is six million, with the vast majority occurring fewer than ten times.)

The tests are arranged in three columns:

1. `Popularity` is the number of times the text appears in the corpus. You can use this column as a way to prioritize how to handle corner cases.
2. `Text` is the raw text of the reference. Tabs and newline characters (`[\t\r\n]`) are converted to spaces; otherwise they appear unaltered from their source.
3. `OSIS` is the OSIS value of the text as parsed by this BCV Parser. If one or more translations appears, it precedes a colon at the start of the string. For example: `Matt 5, 7, NIV, ESV` has an OSIS value of `NIV,ESV:Matt.5,Matt.7`. Otherwise, the OSIS consists only of OSIS references separated by commas. You may choose to interpret certain cases differently to suit your needs, but this column gives you a reasonable starting point from which to validate your parser.

This dataset has a few limitations:

1. It's self-selecting in that it only includes content that this BCV parser understands.
2. It doesn't include as many misspellings as you'd expect because the queries used to retrieve the data only use correct spellings. Misspellings that do occur are incidental--they're part of content that otherwise includes a non-misspelled book name.
3. Its coverage of Deuterocanonical books is very limited; as with misspellings, the queries used to retrieve the data don't include books from the Apocrypha.
4. It doesn't include context that could change the interpretation of the string.
5. Sequences interrupted by translation identifiers are separated: the parsing of `Matt 1 NIV Matt 2 KJV` appears in two separate lines.
6. It reflects the most-popular passages, but corner cases drive most of the complexity in a BCV parser.

## OSIS

[OSIS](http://www.bibletechnologies.net/) is a system for marking up Bibles in XML. The BCV parser only borrows the OSIS system for [book abbreviations](http://www.crosswire.org/wiki/OSIS_Book_Abbreviations) and references. You can control the OSIS specificity using the `osis_compaction_strategy` option.

The parser emits `GkEsth` for Greek Esther rather than just `Esth`. It can include `Ps151` as part of the Psalms (`Ps.151.1`)--the default--or as its own book (`Ps151.1.1`), depending on the `ps151_strategy` option.

## Program Flow

This section describes the parsing of a typical string:

```javascript
bcv = new bcv_parser; // Declare the object
bcv.parse("John 3:16"); // Do the parsing
console.log(bcv.osis()); // "John.3.16"
```

### Matching Potential Passages

The `bcv.parse()` function accepts a string. It first replaces any reserved characters that we're going to need later in the program without affecting any of the character indices.

Then it runs through all the regexps for Bible books (`@match_books()`). In this case, it matches the `John` part of the string and replaces it with the characters `\x1f0\x1f`. The two `\x1f` characters provide boundaries for the match, and the `0` matches an index in the `@books` array we're using to keep track of the original string and some metadata. (If there were more books, they would be `\x1f1\x1f`, `\x1f2\x1f`, etc.) These books aren't necessarily replaced in the order they appear in the string, but rather in the precedence order specified in `@regexps.books`--we want to parse `1 John` before `John` so that program doesn't interpret the `John` in `1 John` as being a separate book. In other words, match longer books first.

Once it has matched all the possible books in the string, we call `@match_passages()` to identify complete passages--we want to be sure to treat strings like `John 3:16, 17` as a single sequence. The `@regexps.escaped_passage` used for these matches is fairly complicated. It looks for some unusual cases (`chapter 23 of Matthew`) first, but it pivots around the escaped book sequence from `@match_books()`: it tries to find numbers and other characters that can comprise a valid sequence after a book (including other books). We know that we'll probably have to trim some of what it finds later; at this point, we want to be as comprehensive as possible.

For each match, we trim some unnecessary parts from the end of it and then run it through the grammar file that identifies the components of the string (in this case, `John 3:16` fits the pattern of a `bcv`, or book-chapter-verse). The grammar uses [PEG.js](http://pegjs.majda.cz/), a [parsing expression grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) with a DSL that compiles to Javascript. A PEG provides predictable performance, especially for shorter strings like Bible references. The grammar identifies components in the match and, importantly, records the indices of where each component starts and ends in the string. PEG.js's built-in extension mechanism provides an easy way to output the necessary data. The tradeoff of using a PEG arrives in the form of increased code size: more than half the code in the minified file comes from the auto-generated grammar.

We also look here for a corner case of the format `1-2 Samuel`, where the book range precedes the book name. If it exists, we construct an object to use later.

After the regexp has found all the matches in the string (and the grammar has taken a pass at them), we return to `@parse`, which loops through the results, sending each one in turn to the `bcv_passage` object.

### Interpreting Grammar Results

The `bcv_passage` object is responsible for the bulk of the heavy lifting in interpreting the output of the grammar. Most of its functions correspond to types (such as `bcv`) returned from the grammar. These functions accept three arguments: a `passage` that reflects the output from the grammar, an `accum` that reflects the processing results thus far, and a `context` that reflects the current processing state--if a function sees a `16` and knows that the context is `John.3`, it can interpret the `16` as a verse number rather than, say, `John.16`. These functions don't alter global state and are safe to run any number of times over the content, a situation that can happen if the initial parsing strategy doesn't work out.

In the case of a `bcv`, the `passage` object consists of two values: a `bc` (the book-chapter combination) and a `v` (the verse number). Since a new book renders any existing context unnecessary, we first get rid of the existing context. We then loop through the possible book values--usually there's only one, but an ambiguous book abbreviation like `Ph` (`Phil` or `Phlm`) can have more than one--to find valid references. For example, given `Ph 20`, we know that only Philemon fits the bill (`Phlm.1.20`) since there's no chapter 20 in Philippians. Much of the logic in functions dealing with books revolves around this process of identifying valid passages.

Once we've identified a viable book, we record the position of the match in the original string, set the `context` for any future processing, and move on. In the case of `John 3:16`, we're done and head back up to `@parse`.

### Ranges

The `bcv` function is fairly straightforward--the logic doesn't get too convoluted. Much of the processing complexity in the parser arises from dealing with ranges that have errors in them or are ambiguous. The basic principle is that end ranges that go beyond the valid end of a book or a chapter are OK--people are often imprecise when it comes to remembering how many chapters are in a book or verses are in a chapter. Four tricky cases arise fairly often, however.

The first tricky case comes from people who like to use hyphens in ways that don't just indicate ranges. For example, the string `Hebrews 13-15` (Hebrews has thirteen chapters) most likely means `Hebrews 13:15`. In some cases, we can guess that that's the case and correct our interpretation. The algorithm the program uses asks whether the end chapter is too high--and if it is, whether the end chapter could be a valid start verse. If so, it proceeds as though that's the case.

The second tricky case arises from strings like `John 10:22-42 vs 27`. In this case, the grammar has indicated that `42 vs 27` is a `cv`, or chapter-verse (in other words, `John.10.22-John.42.27`). However, when the purported end chapter doesn't exist, it makes more sense to treat it as a sequence: `John.10.22-John.10.42,John.10.27`.

The third tricky case stems from strings like `Psalm 123-24`. The grammar output suggests that we should interpret this range as invalid: `Ps.123-Ps.24`. Instead, we choose to interpret it as `Ps.123-Ps.124`. This approach can be aggressive at times: does `Psalm 15-6` really mean `Ps.15-Ps.16`?

The fourth tricky case is similar to the first one: `Jeremiah 33-11` isn't the invalid range `Jer.33-Jer.11` but rather the `bcv` `Jer.33.11`.

If we still couldn't make sense of the range, then we treat is as a sequence of verses instead of a range: `Psalm 120-119` becomes `Ps.120,Ps.119`.

### Translations

Translations are complicated because they propagate backward, whereas passage context propagates forward: `Matt 2 (KJV), Eph 6 (NIV)` means that the KJV should apply to Matthew 2, while the NIV should apply to Ephesians 6.

In theory, some translations could have different books or chapter/verse counts, so if we've made assumptions up to this point that, say, the Apocrypha doesn't exist, we may need to revisit those assumptions. Therefore, we reprocess everything we've already seen.

### Generating Output

With the `bcv_passage` processing complete, we exit the `@parse()` function; you can now ask for the results in the format that's convenient for you.

All the output functions call `@parsed_entities()`. This function loops through the results from `bcv_passage`, constructing an array of objects that other functions can draw from. This function ignores entities you're not interested in and adjusts indices to exclude some entities. For example, you may not want the `Ex` in `Hab 2 Ex`. (You can control this behavior using the options.) Most of the logic involves getting the indices right in corner cases.

This function also creates OSIS strings and can combine consecutive references into a single range (e.g., `John.1,John.2` becomes `John.1-John.2`).

You're probably not calling this function directly but instead are using one of the `osis*()` functions detailed above.

## Performance

Performance degrades linearly with the number of passages found in a string. Using Node.js 0.10.5, it processes 2,000 tweets per second on a single 2.3 GHz core of an EC2 High-CPU Medium instance.

In the worst case, given a string consisting of almost nothing but Bible passage references, it processes about 50-60 KB of text per second.

## Alternate Versification Systems

The BCV parser supports several versification systems (described above). The appropriate versification system kicks in if the parsed text explicitly mentions a translation with an alternate versification system, or you can use `@set_options({"versification_system":"..."})`. You can extend the relevant `translations.coffee` to add additional ones.

## Non-English Support

The Javascript files that don't start with `en` provide support for other languages. The `js/eu/` files provide support for alternate punctuation: commas rather than colons to separate chapters and verses; periods rather than commas to separate sequences.

Using the files in `src/template` as a base, you can add support for additional languages; just use the appropriate ISO 639 language prefix. I'm happy to accept pull requests for new languages.

### Supported Languages

<table>
	<tr><th>Prefix</th><th>Language</th>
	<tr><td>en</td><td>English</td></tr>
	<tr><td>es</td><td>Spanish</td></tr>
	<tr><td>fr</td><td>French</td></tr>
	<tr><td>he</td><td>Hebrew</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ja</td><td>Japanese</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ko</td><td>Korean</td></tr>
	<tr><td>zh</td><td>Chinese (both traditional and simplified)</td></tr>
</table>

When parsing a language that doesn't use Latin-based numbers (0-9), you probably want to set the `non_latin_digits_strategy` option to `ignore`.

When using non-English `<script>`s on the web, be sure the script is served with the `utf-8` character set.

## Compatibility

I've specifically tested the following browsers, but it should work in any modern browser. If not, please feel free to open an issue.

* Internet Explorer 6-10. Support for Internet Explorer 6 and 7 is deprecated; PEG.js doesn't officially support these browsers, though all the tests pass.
* Firefox 12+.
* Chrome 19 and Node 0.10.5.
* Safari 5 (Windows).

## Building

The BCV Parser uses the following projects (none of them is necessary unless you want to edit the source files or run tests):

* [Coffeescript 1.6.2](http://coffeescript.org/) for compiling into Javascript.
* [PEG.js 0.7.0](http://pegjs.majda.cz/) for the parsing grammar.
* [Jasmine 1.3.1](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) for the testing framework. To run tests, install it in the project's `/lib` folder.
* [Closure](http://code.google.com/closure/) for minifying.

The language's grammar file is wrapped into the relevant `*_bcv_parser.js` file. The `space` rule is changed to use the `\s` character class instead of enumerating different space characters. The current version of PEG.js doesn't support the `\s` character class, so we post-process the output to include it.

### Build Instructions

1. In `src`, create a folder named after the [ISO 639 code](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) of the desired language. For example: `fr`.
2. Create a data.txt file inside that folder. Lines that start with `#` are comments. Lines that start with `$` are variables. Lines that start with an OSIS book name are a tab-separated series of regular expressions (a backtick following an accented character means not to allow the unaccented version of that character). Lines that start with `=` are the order in which to check the regular expressions (check for "3 John" before "John," for example). Lines that start with `*` are the preferred long and short names for each OSIS (not used here, but potentially used in a Bible application).
3. In `bin`, run `01.add_lang.pl [ISO code]` to create the `src` files. For example, `01.add_lang.pl fr`.
4. In `bin`, run `02.compile.pl [ISO code]` to create the output Javascript files and tests. This file expects `pegjs` to be available in your `$PATH` and `coffee` to be in `/usr/bin`. For example: `02.compile.pl fr`.

## Purpose

This is the fourth complete Bible reference parser that I've written. It's how I try out new programming languages: the first one was in PHP (2002), which saw production usage on a Bible search website from 2002-2011; the second in Perl (2007), which saw production usage on a Bible-related site starting in 2007; and the third in Ruby (2009), which never saw production usage because it was way too slow. This Coffeescript parser (at least on V8) is faster than the Perl one and 100 times faster than the Ruby one.

I chose Coffeescript out of curiosity--does it make Javascript that much more pleasant to work with? From a programming perspective, the easy loops and array comprehensions alone practically justify its use. From a readability perspective, the code is easier to follow (and come back to months later) than the equivalent Javascript--the tests, in particular, are much easier to follow without all the Javascript punctuation.

This code is in production use on a site that indexes [Bible verses on Twitter and Facebook](http://www.openbible.info/realtime/).

## Changelog
